## About
This is a notes app which supports markdown syntax. The user can add, delete, update, _notes_ and their _tags_ to this app.
The user's data is **cached** in their browser. There's also a search functionality to search/filter notes based on their title and tags.
I was mainly focused on the functonality of the app and decided to only use a minimal style made with bootstrap (at least for now).

The routing of the page was doen with react router.

The caching is done using a custom hook.
